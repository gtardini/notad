Nad is a cross promotion network, meaning there is no distinction publishers and advertisers

Increase your traffic organically by tapping into the NAD cross promotion network. It’ s free.

Nads displayed on your website ( we are planning to expand our network also to Facebook pages and mobile apps, so stay tuned ) are always relevant to your content so that your ruby blog will never show an ad about cooking. You can even filter out certain categories if you don’t want their ads to be displayed on your website ( e.g. direct competitors ). The traffic we deliver is highly targeted and your visitors will be very engaged.

We believe beauty is foundamental when it comes to advertising, and that’s why our nads are simply gorgeous.

Fully customizable ads. Place them wherever you want and even edit their css code. 

How it works: Ads are displayed across the network with a rotation algorithm which ensures equal opportunities to every insertion. Whenever a visitor clicks on the ad displayed on your website, you’ll get a click coming back to your own website, as we’ll promote your ad across the network.

Every website, it’ s a matter of fact, is part of an ecosystem ( e.g. a blog about ruby belongs to the ruby programming language ecosystem, as well as heroku or ruby on rails do ), but it’ s not always easy to benefit from the visitors already present in the ecosystem ( this is especially true for bootstrapped startups or new websites and businesses ).
This is what NAD aims to solve: dinamically cross promoting every website belonging to a given ecosystem we create what we call “interlinked ecosystems” where every single website benefits from the visitors on other websites. Alone we fall, united we stand.
